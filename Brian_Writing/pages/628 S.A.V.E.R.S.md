- **Silence (Meditation)**
	- Find a quiet and comfortable space where you won't be disturbed. Stand against a wall and practice straightening your back. Take deep breaths, focus on your breath, or repeat a calming mantra. Aim for 5-10 minutes of silent meditation to clear your mind and center yourself for the day ahead.
- **Affirmations**
	- Write down positive affirmations that align with your goals and values. Affirmations should be written in the present tense as if already true. Repeat your affirmations aloud with conviction, believing in their truth and power to manifest your desires. Spend 5-10 minutes affirming your goals, strengths, and aspirations, reinforcing a positive mindset.
- **Visualization**
	- Close your eyes and visualize your goals and dreams as if they have already been achieved. Use all your senses to imagine the sights, sounds, feelings, and emotions associated with your success. Visualize yourself overcoming obstacles and enjoying the fruits of your labor. Spend 5-10 minutes vividly picturing your ideal future, strengthening your belief in its realization. Then practice 200-300 memory palaces.
- **Exercise**
	- Exercise to wake up your body and energize yourself for the day. Choose exercises that you enjoy and get your heart rate up, such as jogging, yoga, or calisthenics. Aim for 10-20 minutes of exercise to get your blood flowing and boost your mood and energy levels.
- **Reading**
	- Select a book or article that inspires you or provides valuable insights into personal development or your chosen field. Read for at least 10-20 minutes, focusing on absorbing new knowledge and perspectives to help you grow and improve. Take notes on key ideas or passages that resonate with you, and reflect on how to apply them to your life.
- **Scribing (Journaling)**
	- Take a journal or notebook and write down your thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Reflect on your goals, successes, challenges, and areas for improvement. Write about what you're grateful for and excited about for the day ahead. Spend 5-10 minutes journaling to gain clarity, express gratitude, and set intentions for the day.
